# Nim
This is a Verilog project for programming a version of the subtraction game on an FPGA. Specifically, this was created on the Nexys 3 by Digilent.

The basics of this game may be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim. This version was adapted to allow 1, 2, or 3 players. On each player's turn, he or she may subtract 1, 2, or 3 from the current value. The player to reach 0 wins.

This implementation utilizes a keypad for input and VGA for output.

It was created by Micah Cliffe (https://github.com/minterm) and Alex Waz (https://github.com/alexmwaz).
